# Running Master and Slave DNS server with Bind9 in Ubuntu 24.04

## 1. Requirements :
1. Running 2 servers with Ubuntu 24.04 (running 2 servers)
2. install bind9 on both of them (one for master type and second one for slave)

>[!note]
>I have 2 servers with IP addresses:
>1. 192.168.1.13 (Master)
>2. 192.168.1.107(Slave)

>[!warning]
> In the next part I think you installed bind9 in both of your servers and are ready to use them.
## 2. Config Master DNS server

### First you have to add your zone in ```named.conf.local```.

```
root@server1:/etc/bind# nano named.conf.local
```
```
zone"raman.net"{
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/zones/raman.net.deb";
    allow-transfer{192.168.1.107;};
    allow-update{192.168.1.107;};
    also-notify{192.168.1.107;};
};

zone"1.168.192.in-addr.arpa"{
        type master;
        file"/etc/bind/reverse/1.168.192.in-addr.arpa";
        allow-transfer{192.168.1.107;};
        allow-update{192.168.1.107;};
        also-notify{192.168.1.107;};
};

```
as you see, my zone name is raman.net and the type is master, also my reverse zone is master as well. after that in file item is added zone file database. 
and as I know, I had to grant access to my slave DNS server to see my master zone database, fetch them and add them to cache files.

### Secondly have to add options we need for our DNS server in ```named.conf.options```.
```
root@server1:/etc/bind# nano named.conf.options
```
```
acl"trusted"{
        192.168.1.0/24;
        127.0.0.1;
};

options{
        directory"/var/cache/bind";
        recursion yes;
        allow-recursion{trusted;};
        allow-query{trusted;};
        listen-on{127.0.0.1;192.168.1.13;};
        allow-transfer{192.168.1.107;};

        forwarders{
                8.8.8.8;
                4.2.2.4;
        };
        dnssec-validation no;
        listen-on-v6{any;};
};
```
ACL is an important part because we define who can access our DNS server. in forwarders item, defines forwarders for our DNS server. 

### in this part we need to config raman.net.deb file
```
root@server1:/etc/bind# mkdir zones
root@server1:/etc/bind# cd zones 
root@server1:/etc/bind/zones# nano raman.net.deb
```
```
$TTL 3600
@ IN SOA ns1.raman.net. admin.raman.net.(
     2024052101;Serial
     3600 ;Refresh
     1800 ;Retry
     604800 ;Expire
     86400 ;Minimum TTL
)

@ IN NS ns1.raman.net.
@ IN NS master.raman.net.
@ IN NS slave.raman.net.
@ IN A 192.168.1.13
@ IN A 192.168.1.107
master IN A 192.168.1.13
slave IN A 192.168.1.107
www IN A 192.168.1.13
ns1 IN A 192.168.1.13
```
I added a bunch of DNS records about raman.net and, defined the master and slave of this dns server.

then I also create and add dns records about the reverse zone next.

```
root@server1:/etc/bind# mkdir reverse
root@server1:/etc/bind# cd reverse/
root@server1:/etc/bind/reverse# nano 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa
```
```
$ORIGIN 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.
$TTL 3600
@ IN SOA ns1.raman.net. admin.raman.net.(
        2024052201;Serial
        3600      ;Refresh
        1800      ;Retry
        604800    ;Expire
        86400     ;Minimum TTL
        )
@ IN NS ns1.raman.net.

;PRT Record
13 IN PTR ns1.raman.net.
```
after do this stuff you have to reload dns server so do this command :
```
root@server1:/etc/bind# rndc reload
root@server1:/etc/bind# systemctl status bind9
```
if you write the correct config files, you have to retrieve below status:

![rndc reload](/img/rndc1.png)


## 3. Config slave Dns server
### config ```named.conf.local``` and ```named.conf.options```
slave dns config is like master dns but we replace type with slave in configure files.

> named.conf.local

```
zone "raman.net" {
        type slave;
        file "/etc/bind/zones/raman.net.deb";
        masters{192.168.1.13;};
        };

zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa"{
        type slave;
        file "/etc/bind/reverse/1.168.192.in-addr.arpa";
        masters{192.168.1.13;};
        };
```
> named.conf.options

```
acl "trusted" {
        192.168.1.0/24;
        127.0.0.1;
};
options {
        directory "/var/cache/bind";
        recursion yes; # enables recursive queries
        allow-recursion { trusted; };
        allow-query { trusted; };
        listen-on { 127.0.0.1;192.168.1.13;192.168.1.107; }; # ns1 private IP address - listen on priv>        allow-transfer { none; }; # disable zone transfers by default
        forwarders{
                192.168.1.13;
                8.8.8.8;
                8.8.4.4;
        };
        dnssec-validation no;
        listen-on-v6 { any; };
        };
```
>[!note]
> be sure to create Zones and Reverse folders in bind folder.

in the end if everything run correctly you have see this status :
![rndc reload](/img/rndc2.png) 

and 

![transfer complete](/img/okslave.png)

and after that you can test your dns servers with ```nslookup``` command.
